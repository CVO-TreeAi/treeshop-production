Fort McCoy Project: 8.06 Acres Transformed for Real Estate SuccessWe recently had the opportunity to work with a returning client in Fort McCoy who wanted to prepare her land for sale. When she first reached out, her 8.06-acre property was heavily overgrown and difficult to navigate. We mulched 3.57 acres, opening up the land and giving it a fresh, usable look. She was thrilled with the results and knew it would help showcase the property's true potential.Phase Two: Going FurtherA few months later, she reached back out ready to take things even further. Her goal was to transform more of the property so that potential buyers could easily see the possibilities—not just raw, untouched land.While the scope of work was larger than her budget at first, we worked with her to create a day rate solution that allowed us to:Re-mulch the original areaHandle new growthClear trash and debrisOpen the rest of the land up to a 6" DBH packageThe Transformation ResultsThe transformation was dramatic. Now, when you drive onto the property, you can clearly see the full layout and possibilities of the land. The client was incredibly appreciative that we helped her refresh the original mulched area and connect the newly cleared spaces into one cohesive, open property.She now has the land listed for sale with open houses scheduled.Why Forestry Mulching Adds Real ValueThis project is a great example of how forestry mulching can be a cost-effective solution when preparing property for sale. By clearing underbrush and opening space—without removing dominant trees unnecessarily—buyers can see the land's true potential.Key Benefits for Property Sales:Immediate visual impact: Buyers see usable space, not junglePreserves mature trees: Maintains property character and valueCost-effective: Less expensive than full land clearingQuick turnaround: Ready for showings in days, not weeksReady to prepare your property for sale?
