Equipment was the easy problem. Machines are predictable… on-off, forward- back, mulcher go brr(good).. mulcher don’t go brr (bad) - they depreciate on schedule, burn fuel at known rates, and break down in measurable patterns unless you’re a Chevy or a Bobcat (just a messenger for the Department of Obvious.) Humans are infinitely more complex.Your biggest operational expense isn't that $115,000 CAT 265 or the taxes the government is going to magical convince you to voluntarily pay them. It's the guy operating it. And unlike equipment, most tree companies have no idea what their people actually cost per hour or how to systematically improve their value. Im autistic, which means my brain doesn’t play by the rules simply because the rules exist. Because of this I spend a disproportionally large amount of energy engaging with employees. Having to understand what they aren’t saying, as much as they are, managing payroll and performance with ethical honesty and respect for the man and the family he represents while also protecting customers and the business. It pushed me away from the TCi. I found peace with the employee problem after I did the math. The famous saying of “Follow the money” is a fun problem solving tool to use in business. 

After I started following the money, the employee problem started to present solutions. Not easy ones, but solitons.Spoiler alert- no solution besides the one I authored in the article titles, Employee Problems- Lets Solve Them , was deemed acceptable or worthy of addition to TreeAi EcoSystem. How much a human asset earns in a business should not be based on how liked they are during the application process. These choices should be lead by math and decided on after that. It does not need to be classified what everyone makes. (doesn’t need to be talked about a lot either). Its business, if you pay your employees fairly and with respect then why do they they do not need to be concerned with others. They would have no reason to. Skills will be compared in the new system not pay rate per hour lol.(side note-  I am not setting the hourly rate for each position. Im defining the positions. the local market will dictate the actual adjustments. My pricing is Florida influenced, adjust accordingly.) The TreeShop Employee CodeI developed the coding structure that defines exactly what each employee brings to the table. Take sample employee Mike: "TRS4+S+E3+D3+CRA." He’s a new hire but came to us with this code. To give him a reasonable offer, as well as make sure we are pricing work correctly for projects hes on, we need to establish the value, then assign the price. TreeShop Employee Code broken down: TRS4: Tree Removal Specialist, Level 4 expertise (3-5 years experience)+S: Supervisor qualification (can manage teams, make decisions, has authority)+E3: Advanced equipment certified (bucket trucks, cranes, complex rigging)+D3: CDL Class A (can legally operate any vehicle I own)+CRA: NCCCO crane operator certified (insurance companies care about this)Each component has a calculated cost impact. You can't just pay everyone $25/hour and hope it works out.The True Cost FormulaBase hourly wage is just the starting point. Real cost calculation involves:Tier Multipliers - Experience level affects productivity and decision-making capability:Tier 1 (0-6 months): 1.6x base rateTier 2 (6-18 months): 1.7x base rateTier 3 (18 months-3 years): 1.8x base rateTier 4 (3-5 years): 2.0x base rateTier 5 (5+ years): 2.2x base rateLeadership Premiums - Authority costs extra because responsibility costs extra:Team Leader (+L): +$3.00/hourSupervisor (+S): +$7.00/hourManager levels go salary-basedEquipment Certifications - Specialized skills command premium wages:Basic equipment (+E1): Base expectationIntermediate (+E2): +$1.50/hourAdvanced (+E3): +$4.00/hourSpecialized (+E4): +$7.00/hourProfessional Credentials - Industry certifications that customers recognize and pay for:Crane Operator: +$4.00/hourOSHA Trainer: +$2.00/hourMike's Real Cost:Base Rate: $25.00/hourTier 4 Multiplier (2.0x): Additional $25.00/hourSupervisor Premium: +$7.00/hourAdvanced Equipment: +$4.00/hourCDL Class A: +$3.00/hourCrane Certification: +$4.00/hourTrue Hourly Cost: $68.00/hourWhy This Math Actually MattersWhen you know Mike costs at least $68/hour, you can't send him to trim residential hedges on $150 jobs. You deploy him on complex removals, crane work, and emergency storm response where his skills generate real value.Most TCi companies are accidentally incinerating money by deploying expensive talent on cheap work because they never calculated what their people actually cost. They think they're being efficient by keeping everyone busy. They're actually destroying margins.Two-Step Cost CalculationStep 1: Qualification Code Determines Pay Rate Mike's "TRS4+S+E3+D3+CRA" = $68/hour fair market compensationStep 2: Employee Burden Calculates True Business Cost $68/hour × 1.7 employee burden = $115.60/hour true cost to the business (I will do an article about this later. That 1.7x multiplier covers payroll taxes, workers comp, benefits, and overhead allocation. So while Mike earns $68/hour, he actually costs you $115.60/hour to employ.)Why This Two-Step System WorksFair Compensation: The qualification code ensures you're paying market rates for actual capabilities, not arbitrary amounts based on negotiation or favoritism. This means you take your career with you as you go. There is a very favorable effect that will occur in the industry after this takes effect. There will become a pride that is real (outside of the tree guy fanfare post disaster.) A stability worth building a business with. Accurate Costing: The burden multiplier gives you the real hourly cost for job pricing and crew deployment decisions. Knowing what you need to charge is all you need to know. Market price doesn’t actually matter. Build the dream team and pay for it, or stack some rookies and ball out on margins. Professional Management: Mike knows exactly what his qualifications are worth and what he needs to develop to earn more. You know exactly what he costs to deploy on different projects. WIN WIN. Business ApplicationWhen pricing jobs, you use the $115.60/hour true cost. When managing advancement and raises, you reference the $68/hour qualification-based pay rate.Mike can't work on jobs that bill less than $115.60/hour without losing money. But his raise discussions focus on developing additional qualifications that justify higher compensation within the systematic framework.This creates both fair employee treatment and accurate business costing - solving the dual problem of professional workforce management in an industry that typically handles both poorly.Till next time:Jeremiah AndersonMrTreeShop
