The forestry mulching industry has long struggled with inconsistent pricing methods that leave contractors guessing and customers confused. While some charge by the hour, others price by the acre, but neither approach accurately reflects the true complexity and work volume of each project. Thats why I sat down and mathed out a better way! Inch Acres – the volumetric pricing system that finally brings scientific precision to forestry mulching quotes.The Problem with Current Pricing MethodsTraditional pricing models fall short because they fail to account for the most critical factor in forestry work: tree size. Consider these scenarios:- Scenario A: 1 acre with a limit of 6-inch diameter trees and under- Scenario B: 1 acre with 15-inch diameter trees and underUnder current pricing methods, both projects might be quoted the same per-acre rate. Yet any experienced operator knows that clearing 15-inch trees requires exponentially more time, fuel, and equipment wear than 6-inch trees. The current system doesn't reflect this reality. So whats the price increase supposed to be to accurately reflect the 15 inch tree project vs the 6 inch tree project. Introducing Inch Acres (iA)Inch Acres provides a simple, elegant solution by combining two fundamental project variables:Formula: Acres × DBH Limit = Inch Acres (iA)…. I know… Its that simple. Trust me. Where DBH (Diameter at Breast Height) represents the largest trees that need to be mulched. At the completion point you should be able to go back across the entire project area and define definition of done by the DBH of the trees remaining. (Yes, sometimes smaller trees are left regardless of targeting becase of site conditions, selective mulching (a common one in Florida is don’t mulch the magnolia trees. )Real-World Examples- Small project: 1 acre × 6" DBH = 6 iA- Large project: 2.5 acres × 8" DBH = 20 iA- XX-Large project: 5 acres × 15" DBH = 75 iAThis volumetric approach immediately reveals the true scope of work. The 75 iA project represents over 12 times more work than the 6 iA project – a reality that traditional per-acre pricing completely misses.Why Inch Acres Works1. Reflects True Work VolumeLarger trees increase the work required. A 15-inch tree doesn't just take twice as long as a 6-inch tree – it requires more powerful equipment, generates more material to process, and demands greater operator skill. Density is set by nature, it’s stable even though it is an independent data point. The math is not simple to explain but summarize it up as: It washes out in the average. This is only true by region. The time it takes you to do 15 iA in Michigan might be 30 minutes more or less than Pennsylvania right. But thats ok, the pricing adjusts naturally.  2. Creates Fair Market PricingWith Inch Acres, contractors can establish a single rate per iA (such as $450/iA, $325/iA, $1500iA) that applies consistently across all forestry mulching projects. The rate would be indicative of the employee and equipment loadout. Higher billing rate does not always mean higher production rates either. Same work volume equals same price, regardless of how the acres and tree sizes combine. I have a simple system to help you establish your iA Rate so don’t worry! Yes, math can really fix all the impossible things. I know it sounds crazy but don’t take my word for it, test it, stress it, break it. Tell me. I have more layers and more articles coming but this is the basics. Building a foundation. For real, go run this system parallel to your daily system now. It won’t take that much more effort. You will see. The iA system for forestry mulching is hands down the most intelligent and effective pricing system ever used to quote a project in this industry.3. Simplifies QuotingInstead of complex calculations considering dozens of variables, contractors need only measure two things: total acres and maximum DBH. The Inch Acre calculation instantly provides the work volume.4. Enables Accurate BiddingCustomers can finally compare bids fairly. A quote of $9,000 for 20 iA can be directly compared to another contractor's rate per iA, eliminating the confusion of different pricing methodologies. When you remove pricing as a decision, the customer will default to the value purchase rather than the budget purchase. ONLY IF VALUE IS PRESENT. If you do not provide value at the proposal stage, then the customer will default to the price factor. Response Time and Reviews will become a very big factor I believe once this system is operational in an area.Industry TransformationFor Contractors- Consistent profitability through standardized pricing- Faster quoting with simple measurements- Professional credibility through scientific pricing methods- Competitive advantage with transparent, defendable pricingFor Customers- Fair pricing that reflects actual work complexity- Easy bid comparison across multiple contractors- Transparent methodology they can understand and trust- Consistent results regardless of property configurationImplementation StrategyStep 1: Establish Your RateDetermine your true hourly costs by building out your loadouts correctly. Once you know the number you need to charge to hit your goals you have your rate in iA per hour to establish your price per iA. This does mean that you have to run some projects old school while you establish your base. It only takes a couple projects and you can even scale out smaller projects to project their math ahead. I can help you figure it all out as needed. If you want to just jump in then you can use this formula Step 2: Measure and CalculateFor each project, measure total acres and identify the largest DBH that needs clearing. Multiply these figures to get total iA.Step 3: Price and ProposeMultiply total iA by your established rate per iA. This becomes your project price – simple, accurate, and profitable.The Future of Forestry PricingInch Acres represents more than just a pricing method – it's the foundation for industry standardization. When contractors across the country adopt this volumetric approach, the entire industry benefits from:- Standardized terminology that everyone understands- Consistent pricing models that customers can trust- Professional credibility that elevates the entire trade- Data-driven decisions based on measurable work unitsGetting StartedThe transition to Inch Acres doesn't require new equipment or extensive training – just a commitment to more accurate, scientific pricing. Start by calculating the iA volume for your recent projects and comparing the results to your pricing. You'll quickly see how this volumetric approach reveals the true complexity relationships between different types of work.The forestry mulching industry stands at a crossroads. We can continue with inconsistent, outdated pricing methods that frustrate contractors and confuse customers, or we can embrace a scientific, volumetric approach that benefits everyone involved.Inch Acres isn't just a simpler method – it's the future of forestry mulching services.
