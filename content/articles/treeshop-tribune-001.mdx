# TreeShop Tribune #001: Why Price Matching is Fear-Based Business

I need to tell you something that's going to piss off half the people reading this: when you ask me to match a competitor's price, you're not being smart with your money. You're scared. And when I drop my price to win your business, I'm not being competitive. I'm scared too.

We're both afraid of the same thing—failure. And we've both decided to let price be the safety net that catches us before we have to actually think about what we're doing.

Here's the uncomfortable truth: **price is never really an objection. It's a security blanket.** It's the thing buyers hide behind when they don't know how to evaluate what they're actually buying. It's the thing sellers hide behind when they don't believe their work is worth defending.

And every single time someone makes a buying or selling decision based primarily on price, fear just handled their project. Not strategy. Not wisdom. Not experience. Fear.

## The Real Conversation Underneath the Words

When a property owner says, "I got a quote for $6,500 but yours is $12,000—can you match theirs?" here's what I actually hear:

*"I have no idea how to evaluate whether your work is better than theirs. I don't understand what I'm buying. The only number I can compare is the dollar amount, so that's what I'm going to make this decision on."*

And when a contractor immediately says, "Yeah, I can do it for $6,500," here's what they're actually communicating:

*"I don't believe my work is worth $12,000 even though I quoted it. I'm afraid if I don't win this bid, there won't be another one."*

Both parties think they're making rational economic decisions. Neither of them is. They're both just trying not to lose.

**And that's exactly how they're both going to lose.**

## The Pattern of Failure

Let me walk you through how this actually plays out:

You hire the $6,500 guy. He shows up with lightweight rental equipment. It's underpowered for the job, so what should take a day takes three.

While struggling with equipment, he accidentally takes out three trees you wanted to keep because he was rushing. Those trees were worth $15,000+ in property value. Gone.

He doesn't know about wetland regulations. He clears into a protected zone. Three months later: $15,000 fine for unauthorized wetland disturbance.

Building inspector fails you because root systems weren't properly cleared. You need a second contractor to fix it: $13,500.

**Let's do the math:**
- Original "cheap" bid: $6,500
- Lost tree value: $15,000
- State fine: $15,000
- Remediation work: $13,500
- **Total cost: $50,000**

That $12,000 professional bid is looking pretty good right about now.

## What Competing on Value Actually Looks Like

When a customer says, "Why is your price higher?" you need to be able to say:

*"When you call us, you get a response in hours, not days. We use TreeAI assessment to give you accurate quotes. Within 24 hours you have a clear proposal showing what your land will look like when we're done.*

*Our systematic model prices jobs based on actual production rates for your specific property conditions. No surprises, no change orders.*

*That's what you're paying for. Not just the physical work—the business model that makes this process predictable, transparent, and professional."*

## The Questions That Actually Matter

For property owners evaluating contractors:

1. **"What insurance do you carry, and does it cover this specific work?"**
2. **"What equipment will you use and why?"**
3. **"How do you handle unexpected issues?"**
4. **"Can you show me photos from similar projects?"**
5. **"Why should I hire you instead of the cheaper option?"**

If they immediately drop their price: **Red flag.**
If they clearly articulate their value: **Green flag.**

## Professional Standards

**For Tree Shop, minimum acceptable profit is 30%.**

If you're running below 20% margins, you don't have room for problems. And problems always happen.

Below 15% and you're just creating jobs for employees while slowly going bankrupt.

## The Bottom Line

**Price is a tool. Use it. But don't hide behind it.**

The contractors who are thriving aren't the cheapest ones. They're the ones who got comfortable with their value and stopped apologizing for it.

The property owners who are happy aren't the ones who saved the most money. They're the ones who hired professionals and treated their land like it mattered.

**Choose courage. Choose value. Choose better.**
