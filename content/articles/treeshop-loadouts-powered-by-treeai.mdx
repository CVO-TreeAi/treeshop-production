The Problem with the Old GuardThe tree care industry (TCi) has long relied on a broken pricing model. Most companies slap an hourly rate on every job—whether it’s pruning a shrub or tackling a complex crane removal—and hope it covers costs. Many even base their prices on what competitors charge, not on actual data. Shop the market. lol. Really?This isn’t strategy; it’s guesswork. As the saying goes, failing to plan is planning to fail.The TCi doesn’t need more government regulations or bureaucratic oversight. Organizations like OSHA, ANSI, and ISA already provide solid frameworks. The industry thrives when it’s self-regulated, driven by professionals who prioritize trees, customers, and the skilled workers who keep it moving. Leaders in the TCi should focus on innovation, not restrictive acronyms from people who can’t identify a tree species or start a saw.Introducing Loadouts: Precision Over GuessworkYou’ve heard about the Employee Problem and MoneyBall equipment costing. Now it’s time to combine them into a game-changing system: Loadouts.What Is a Loadout?A Loadout is a strategic combination of personnel and equipment tailored to deliver specific results for specific jobs. Think of it like a football team adjusting its lineup based on the situation:3rd and short? Heavy formation with run blockers.Red zone? Specialized personnel for tight spaces.Hail Mary? Speed receivers and protection packages.Tree service works the same way. Different jobs demand different asset combinations. Yet most companies send the same crew and equipment to every job, hoping it works out. Loadouts change that by matching the right resources to the task.Examples:Residential pruning? No need for a crane-certified specialist or a $350/hour crane.Complex commercial removal over power lines? You do need that crane and certified crew.Storm cleanup with 50+ trees down? Deploy an Emergency Response Loadout with rapid-deployment equipment and employees who know they are on standby.Loadouts ensure you use the right tools and people—no more, no less—while guaranteeing profitability and fair pricing. This does not fix the price, this does not set the price. No anti-trust angle here because all TreeAi does is reveal the true costs, adjust to user settings to define price, and then maintains the system dynamically going forward....its like Google— but for the TCI The Old Way: A Recipe for FailureHere’s the broken system we’re leaving behind:One hourly rate for all jobs, whether pruning hedges or removing trees over power lines.Sales reps quote vague rates, hoping to “get on base.”Underbidding jobs, then scrambling with change orders to make a profit.Charging “$1000/hour for tree work” regardless of complexity.Guessing margins and praying they work out.This is amateur hour. Amateurs guess. Professionals call their shots. We don't do estimates anymore. Estimate implies aiming at but accepting misses. Aim small miss small. Call your shots. With Loadouts, you know:The true cost of each asset combination.The exact billing rate that ensures profit.The right Loadout for each job’s requirements.If there’s no profit, there’s no point. Loadouts make every job profitable by design.TreeAi Loadouts:Here’s how Loadouts work in practice. Each is a carefully calculated package of personnel and equipment, with costs and rates built to ensure profitability. As you saw in the employee articles, we can establish the true cost of an employees labor by factoring in the burden. For equipment we did the opposite, we break it down to its smallest hourly rate. What does this machine cost to own per hour of operation? When you mix those you get something that should look like light examples:Light Maintenance LoadoutPersonnel: 1x ATC3+E2 (Arboriculture specialist: $89/hour true cost)Equipment: 1x Pickup truck + trailer ($31/hour operating cost)Total Cost: $120/hourProfessional Rate: $156/hour (30% markup)Deploy For: Pruning, light trimming, consultationsStandard Removal LoadoutPersonnel:1x TRS4+S (Tree Removal Lead: $115/hour true cost)1x EQO3+D3 (Equipment Operator: $77/hour true cost)Equipment:1x Bucket truck ($78/hour operating cost)1x Chipper truck ($67/hour operating cost)Total Cost: $337/hourProfessional Rate: $438/hour (30% markup)Deploy For: Most residential/commercial removalsPremium Crane Operations LoadoutPersonnel:1x TRS4+S+CRA (Crane-certified lead: $124/hour true cost)1x TRS3+E3 (Advanced climber: $95/hour true cost)1x EQO4+CRA (Crane operator: $108/hour true cost)Equipment:1x Crane truck ($89/hour operating cost)1x Support trucks ($78/hour operating cost)Total Cost: $494/hourProfessional Rate: $642/hour (30% markup)Deploy For: Complex removals, utility work, technical operationsThe Professional DifferenceWhen a customer calls, amateurs say, “Tree work is $150/hour plus equipment.” Professionals analyze the job and respond with precision:Professional Response: “Based on the scope, this requires our Standard Removal Loadout at $438/hour, which includes a TRS4-qualified lead, certified equipment operator, bucket truck, and chipper. Estimated 6-hour deployment for a total project cost of $2,628 plus disposal.”One sounds like a guy with a truck hoping to make money. The other sounds like a systematic operation that knows exactly what it’s doing.How to Get Started TodayTreeShop Ops will automate this process, but you can start now. Here’s how:Step 1: Gather Your Pricing DataCompile the following:Employee Data:TreeShop Employee Codes (e.g., TRS3, EQO4). (tools coming soon)True hourly cost (including payroll taxes, workers’ comp, benefits).Certifications and specializations.Equipment Data:Purchase price and depreciation schedule.Operating costs per hour (fuel, maintenance, insurance).Utilization rates and runtime hours.you read the article or you didn't. Current Job Data:What you’ve been charging.Actual job costs.Where you’re making or losing money.Step 2: Understand Your Real CostsAnalyze your three most common job types:What personnel and equipment do you typically send?What’s the real hourly cost of those combinations?What should you charge to ensure profit?Step 3: Build Your First Three LoadoutsStart small. Design Loadouts for:Your most common job (e.g., Standard Removal).Your highest-margin specialty (e.g., Crane Operations).Your high-volume work (e.g., Basic Maintenance or Land Clearing).Calculate true costs and set professional rates.Step 4: Track ResultsFor every Loadout-based job, track:Actual time vs. estimated time.Actual costs vs. calculated costs.Profit margins vs. projections.This data will refine your Loadouts and prove the system works.The Brutal RealityYour competitors are still guessing—sending random crews and equipment, charging what “feels right,” and wondering why they’re not building wealth. With Loadouts, you’ll deploy strategic asset packages with known costs and guaranteed profits.When competitors struggle to justify their $200/hour “tree work,” you’ll confidently explain why your Standard Removal Loadout at $438/hour delivers superior results. This isn’t about charging more for the same work—it’s about delivering systematically better service and pricing it like the professional operation you’re becoming.Amateurs guess. Professionals call their shots. Which one are you?What’s Next?Next week, we’ll dive into “The Implementation Blueprint”—how to deploy Loadout systems in existing operations without disrupting cash flow, including the change management needed to shift from guesswork to precision.TreeShop Maps is free.
