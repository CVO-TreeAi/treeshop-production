Combining the CAT skid steer with the Blackhawk mulcher translates into much faster land clearing. In practice, Tree Shop crews can down and mulch large trees in minutes. One field report noted a 50-foot pine was ground up in less than a minute, and a 16″ oak tree in about three minutes. Even dense clusters of palmetto and understory can be quickly reduced. 

In one example, two 24″ water oaks 15 feet from a house were felled and mulched in ~27 minutes – with the house and patio left "completely unscathed". By contrast, using chainsaws or bulldozers would take far longer and risk collateral damage.

## Professional Finish Quality

The finish is clean. The Blackhawk's knives produce cuts comparable to a chainsaw, meaning no ragged stumps or broken limbs. Instead, trees are turned into uniform chips. This neat mulched layer often eliminates follow-up cleanup: there's nothing bulky to haul away. 

In one case Tree Shop mulched a sandy driveway; the owner happily drove on the wood chips instead of laying new gravel. As a result, clients can typically move directly to site development or planting. Customers note that mulching "Phase #1" of clearing is often completed in a single day, with the land "now usable and spot on to [their] vision".

## Why This Setup Benefits Landowners and Contractors

For landowners and developers, Tree Shop's CAT + Blackhawk setup means faster jobs and better outcomes:

**Rapid clearing**: Large areas of Florida brush can be shredded in hours, not days. This saves labor and equipment rental time.

**No secondary disposal**: Everything is mulched on-site, avoiding costly hauling or burning of debris.

**Safer, greener process**: No use of herbicides or open burning. Mulching helps hold moisture and prevent erosion.

**Better final grade**: The skid steer's maneuverability and precise mulching allow a "spot-on" finish, ready for the next phase of construction or landscaping.

**Versatility**: From sandy scrub to planted pines to oak forests, the Fecon Blackhawk on a skid steer handles it all.

## Professional Experience Matters

Tree Shop brings professional experience to every job. As their site states, "We specialize in forestry mulching, land clearing, and other land development projects". Owner-operated since 2016, the company focuses on honesty and quality – they even showcase before/after videos of heavy underbrush being cleared by their CAT mulchers. 

With decades of combined experience, Tree Shop technicians know how to adjust the CAT skid steer and Fecon Blackhawk to Florida's specific challenges (even avoiding felling protected palms and working around property features). As one testimonial noted, Tree Shop's machines and skill were "phenomenal" – and they will be "recommending [them] to everybody".
