Florida's forests and scrublands can be thick and tough. Pine flatwoods often have slash or longleaf pines with dense saw palmetto understories, while oak hammocks grow on sandy hills and ridges. Saw palmetto in particular "thrives in sandy soils" and is "tough as nails" to remove. To clear this mix of palmettos, pines, oaks and other stringy brush, Tree Shop uses forestry mulching rather than cut-and-haul. 

Forestry mulching grinds trees, palms and underbrush into mulch on site, leaving a clean layer of woodchips that slowly decompose – enriching the soil and preventing erosion. As Tree Shop notes, mulching is "a popular choice for land clearing in Florida, where there is often a lot of thick underbrush", because it is efficient, cost-effective and eco-friendly.

## Why Fecon Blackhawk Excels in Florida

**Tough vegetation**: The Fecon Blackhawk mulcher is built for stringy, fibrous, dense plants – exactly Florida's underbrush.

**High speed**: Operators report mulching a 50-ft pine in under a minute and a 16″ oak in ~3 minutes, dramatically faster than chainsaws or manual clearing.

**Clean finish**: The land is left with finely chopped mulch (not piles of logs). One contractor left behind "a neat pile of mulch" after felling oaks, with all trees reduced to "equally sized, finely chopped pieces".

**Full processing**: The Blackhawk's design even picks up felled material, so "nothing is left behind" unprocessed.

**Environmental benefits**: The remaining mulch feeds the soil and controls erosion, making for a healthier site.

## Fecon Blackhawk Skid-Steer Mulcher Attachment

At the heart of Tree Shop's operation is the Fecon Blackhawk – a heavy-duty mulching head mounted on a CAT skid steer. Fecon describes the Blackhawk as "the mulcher for tackling vegetation management and land clearing needs in stringy, fibrous, dense, and fast-growing materials". 

It's essentially a land clearing attachment for skid steer loaders: a steel drum with replaceable "Viking axe" teeth that grinds through brush and small trees. For example, the 76″ Blackhawk (model BK7618) uses a high-displacement 107cc hydraulic motor and is rated for flows of ~30–50 GPM (up to 132 HP). Fecon's specifications note it can "efficiently mulch up to 8″ material", meaning it easily cuts through 6–8″ limbs. Its universal skid-steer mount and adjustable push bar make it simple to attach to Cat loaders, and its wear-resistant AR400 shoes and steel body handle Florida's sandy, rough terrain.

Tree Shop typically uses Caterpillar skid steers (e.g. CAT 299D3 or similar models) equipped with high-flow hydraulic circuits. The CAT machines provide the power and mobility needed: robust engines, reinforced undercarriages, and even forestry packages for cooling and visibility. The skid steer can maneuver through tight spots, soft sand or uneven ground, and even operate on moderate slopes. In fact, one customer quipped how the operator "jump[ed] on that beast, on a 20+% inclination" – testament to the skid steer's agility and the operator's skill.

Tree Shop's team is trained to use the CAT skid steers safely and effectively, always grinding the underbrush flush rather than leaving stumps or debris.
