Most people see the tree industry as chainsaws, mulch, and hard labor in the heat. And that's true — but for me, it has been much more than just clearing land or grinding stumps. My career so far has been about freedom, independence, and building something that lasts. It's about taking the lessons of sweat, dirt, and bark, and transforming them into systems that will change the way this industry operates.

I started like many others: "If he can do it so can I", hands-on, running equipment, learning what it means to do the work the right way. Over the years, I've spent countless hours in machines, behind saws, and on job sites, gaining a practical knowledge that no textbook could teach. I know what it takes to clear the land as well as care for trees, the patience needed to remove piles of hurricane damaged trees out of houses, and the costs that pile up when your equipment breaks down in the field... and everything in between!

## Building Tree Shop: Our Independence Story

That's where Tree Shop was born. My wife and I built our own business because we value independence more than anything. We wanted to run things our way — without middlemen, without government hands in our pockets, and without compromise. We made YouTube videos, not just to promote ourselves, but to show people the reality of what this work looks like: raw, tough, but also deeply rewarding.

But somewhere along the way, I realized the tree industry had a problem. The way we track jobs, manage equipment, and plan work hasn't changed in decades. The systems are outdated, and most "solutions" come from outsiders who don't know what it's like to spend 12 hours behind a mulcher in Florida heat. That realization lit a fire in me: if no one else was going to build the operating system this industry needs, then I would.

## TreeAI: The Future of Tree Industry Operations

That's where TreeAI comes in. TreeAI isn't just software — it's the professional operating system for the entire tree industry. The goal is simple: take everything I've learned in the field, and build a platform that makes businesses more efficient, more profitable, and more free. Whether it's proposal building, job tracking, AI assistants, or geospatial planning, TreeAI is about giving operators the tools they deserve.

My career so far has been a mix of grit and vision. From chainsaws and mulchers to designing AI agents and system architectures, it's all connected by one mission: to elevate the tree industry into the future, without losing the independence and toughness that built it in the first place.

## The Connection Between Tools and Technology

TreeAI is to TCI as 2-stroke gas is to a chainsaw. Won't be able to operate without it... unless these battery units somehow win lol. TreeAI would then be more valuable because I can connect to those saws somehow I bet and get even more random data lol.

This is just the beginning.

The tree industry deserves better tools, better systems, and better respect. TreeAI is how we get there — one line of code, one AI agent, and one independent operator at a time.
